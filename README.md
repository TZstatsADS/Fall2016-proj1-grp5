+ Project summary: We utilized the personal data provided by the American Community Survey from 2014 in order to analyse what factors might contribute to a person being self employed. These factors include education level (SCHL), field of degree (FOD1P), race (RACE), disability (DIS), sex (SEX), whether they are native or foreign born (NATIVITY), and citizenship status (CIT).
